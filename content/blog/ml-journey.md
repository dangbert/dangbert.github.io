title: My Machine Learning Journey
---

This page serves as a plan / means of tracking my progress in learning about machine learning and neural networks.

### Currently Doing:
* Reading, taking notes and coding the examples in: [neural networks and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap3.html)

### Future Plan:
* Read my old AP stat notes
* Read and take notes: [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
