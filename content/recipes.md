## Baking (Desserts):

* mix:
  * 2-3 very ripe, mashed, bananas
  * 1.5 cup flour
  * ~3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup for less sweet, 1 cup for extra sweet)

#### [Pie Crust](http://www.marthastewart.com/856573/basic-pie-dough-apple-pie) [2 crusts or a complete double pie crust]
* Tips: Finely chop the butter and mix with everything except the flour in the nutribullet, then combine with the flour.
  * Even better would be to mix half of the mix at a time (because nutribullet is not ideal for this)
* Also I found that the dough ball was too hard after sitting in the fridge for an hour, I had to let it sit out afterwards before working it.  But it's a good recipe.

#### [Apple Pie](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12682/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/)
* I followed the recipe above (doubled for two pies) but baked it according to [this recipe](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/apple-pie/) and added the spices (ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg) from that recipe as well.
  * BUT the first pie I baked was very soupy after cutting, so the second one I left in the over for like an additional 40 minutes and then there were no issues.  (But also I may have not added enough flour when following the recipe).
  * I used 6.5 pounds of apples between the two pies and still had almost 2 pounds of apples left.
  * Also I should have chopped the apples much finer (the smaller the better), mine were not soft enough after baking.

### [Pumpkin Pie](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/23439/perfect-pumpkin-pie/)
  
#### [Pumpkin Bread](https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/spiced-pumpkin-bread.html) [~??? cal, 1 loaf]

  * 7.5 oz pumpkin puree
  * 1 cup flour
  * 1 cup sugar (I tried 0.8 and it wasn't super sweet)
  * 3/4 stick unsalted butter, softened/mashed
  * 1 large egg
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 3/4 tsp baking soda (I increased this because I'm not suring baking powder)
  * 1/2 tsp ground cloves
